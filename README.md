### 6. JWT Integration:
__In my project, I've made sure to focus on user security, and I've implemented a JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to make it all work smoothly. JWT acts like a secure key that helps users log in, stay logged in, and use the website safely, all while keeping their data private. It's the backbone of my page security and user experience.__
